# Fast Api sqlalchemy School REST Api
This is my first Python REST Api project. I used Fast Api framework and sqlalchemy library as ORM. School Api is live on Heroku: https://fast-api-school.herokuapp.com/

## Testing and documentation
School REST Api's interactive documentation is automatically generated by Fast Api framework and can be found here: 
https://fast-api-school.herokuapp.com/docs

Alternative documentation is also generated by FastApi and can be found here: https://fast-api-school.herokuapp.com/redoc

## Notes
This project is fully functional, but not finished. So far, I created Database of Students, and query end points that relate to them. 
I intent to expand this API with list of teachers, classes, and create more end points.

This application is created for my own learning purpose and training
